\chapter{Main points of development}

		We all wanted to do a 3D game , because we wish that the player has more possibilities than
		the classics jumping, going forward and backward.
		\\
		The game will be like all traditional platform games, the player will be able to interact with
		some object of the environment in 3D, take bonuses and penalties.
		We are not decided yet to give the possibility to attack in order to kill,
		it will depend of the time needed to have a way to defense.
		They will be an introduction chapter, to introduce the player to the game mechanics,
		and then the level of difficulty will increase at each chapter .
		\\
		To simplify our work, we decided to code in C\# which is more "human friendly"
		than the other language we were proposed, OCaml.
		For the graphics, we can make our own textures with GIMP or Adobe Photoshop
		but most of the textures will be taken from the Internet.
		We will work with Unity and Visual Studio and the different tools which are available on Framework.NET
		in order to ensure that there are no conflict between our codes.
		\\
		The code has to prepared for all cases and cope with the various errors.
		It has to be easily understandable and optimized.
