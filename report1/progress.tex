			My priority was to do our website, suicide-squad.esy.es. That's why right before the vacations I met up with Aymeric,
			so we could do the outline of the website. The site was online shortly after, which let us lots of time to improve it,
			implementing our own bug tracker and other useful stuff.
			\\
			Then I had to meet up again with Aymeric because he needed some scripts to complete his levels.
			I jumped at this opportunity to start learning how worked Git, and how to use it, such that I was able to write a little usage manual for me,
			and, above all, my teammates, so we were able to work together on our project with this powerful tool.

		\subsection{Expectations and Feelings}
			I'm pretty happy with how the website came up. I am also really confident in the development of this game.
			I know there is still a long road until we could say "we made a real game", but I know this day will come!

			\\\\\\
			Firstly, I had to write the synopsis and the storyline.
			It was very important to be done quickly so the other members of the group could know what to do in the level.
			Then, I had to learn the basics of Unity, even if it was not really a need at this time, but it was interesting
			and I knew it would be easier after.
			\\
			Then I helped Aymeric with the architecture of the first level.
			\\
			And because I am in charge of the sound of the game, I researched a lot of sounds which will be great,
			and music game aswell as sound effect. I found what I have searched and how to put some sound in the game,
			but I could not put many because my scripts were not perfect.

		\subsection{Expectations and Feelings}
			I think the project is progressing well but I have to admit that the work I have done is not the most significant part.
			But it is still a great pleasure to work in this project despite all the pressure.
			I learned already a lot of information since the beginning, and it give me the will to continue to work for it.

			I first learned how to manipulate unity, then I thought of what is going to be in the first level.
			So, The game ( you just lost it) begins peacefully by the tutorial. With that in mind,
			I created the two first levels with some help from Thibault (help on 3D object).
			\\\\
			Afterwards, the essential question, for me, was what atmosphere should be given to the Tutorial Chapter.
			Textures, Skyboxes, settings/decorations, are made in order to give an oniric atmosphere (strange structures, soft textures).

			I feel like my objectives are accomplished, the Chapter one is fully designed, only one script is missing until it is fully finished.
			I wish I could have a bit more time in order to make little more details.
			\\
			I love the universe of the game, so itâ€™s a pleasure to work on this project,
			even if sometimes it is difficult to agree with all the group.
			\\
			People are getting on well in the group so, there is a good working atmosphere.
			\\
			I discover that I can realy stress people for a work I realy need, which can be annoying for people in the group but essential for me.

			\\\\\\
			So, I first learned how to use unity to be able to understand how to create decors and textures, then I practiced a little on script writing and how use them in Unity.
			\\
			Just after those tutorials I learned how to use Blender to be able to design some useful elements for the game.


		\subsection{Expectations and feelings}
			My primary objective was to understand Unity and Blender which is now fulfilled. My expectations about the design of the game have been realised. I took pleasure to design objects on demand of Aymeric; I create, he implements. Even if as of right now I didn't do a lot of objects because we just want to have an overview of the levels to complete them after, with some more decors.
