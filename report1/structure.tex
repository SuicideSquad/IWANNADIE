\chapter{Structure}

	Our project is a game, and we want this game to be in 3D. It will be a reflexion and a platform game
	so we need to make different levels. That is why we need designated level designers. In our game,
	we will implement sounds and cutscenes. We also need to add an AI for a few non-player characters
	and a network to play online with other players.
	\\
	To make our game accessible for all, we will create a website, in which there will be a way to download the game,
	a presentation of the project, like the game, the team members and the evolution of the game.
	It would also need links to the softwares and the elements, like sounds and images, we will use.
	\\
	We want to make a trailer, a short advertisement, which would tempt people to play the game.
	To show the progression of the project, this trailer will progress with it,
	thus the viewer will see new part of the game.
	\\
	To realize this project, we will need to work separately on different task. But those tasks must be put together,
	so we will use a distributed revision control with Git to allow us to share files and parts of the game easily.
	\\
	This project will also have costs because we will use a lot of softwares like Unity, Visual Studio and Audacity,
	and we will also need some material resources.
