\chapter*{Conclusion}

		We are sure of the success of this project, because we all are very motivated about it.
		We know our actual skills, and thus we know this project is feasible in six months.
		\\
		We also have a lot of ideas to add in our project, we are focused on the principals parts,
		but if we finish those parts earlier than expected, we could still add a lot of things.
		\\
		So we hope you will support us in this project, because it became very important to us.
		\\
		We also would like to thank you for reading this book of specifications, and maybe for helping us with it.
