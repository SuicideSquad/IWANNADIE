\chapter{Synopsis}

	  The game is based after the film "Inception" by Christopher Nolan (a spin-off, you would say).
	  Our character knows that, if he is in a dream and can wake up only by dying,
	  he has no proof that the current world he lives in is the real one. His only way to be sure is to die,
	  so he decided to commit suicide since, it is his only way to be really sure that he is not just dreaming.
	  But in his quest for a real world, he would have to show his ability to commit suicide in dreams,
	  which can be very friendly and a little too safe to die, and his will of traveling between worlds.
